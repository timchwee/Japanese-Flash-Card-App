I want to build a Japanese Flashcard App.
In the JP_3000.xlsx file uploaded are 3000 japanese words.

I want to:

1. have it flash 10 'japanese', 'romanji' and 'translations' per day. As per the column.
2. there is a 'day' column that represents each day.
3. it flashes 1 word at a time, and there will be a 'back' button on the left and a 'next' button on the right.
4. on the 10th card for the day, the 'back' button on the left will be replaced with the 'restart day N' button  and the 'next' right button will be replaced with a 'day N' button (n representing the next day number)
